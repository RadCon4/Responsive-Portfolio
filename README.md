## Responsive-Portfolio

### Synopsis
***

This is an example of a responsive portfolio site using HTML/CSS. This was another test of my basic design skills as a front-end web designer. 

The responsive portfolio site consists of 3 html documents, two css files (including the Meyerweb reset.css), and images.
